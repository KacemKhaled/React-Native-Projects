# React Native Projects

This repository has the code of the apps done within the course on [**Udemy: React Native the Partical Guide**](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/). 


## How to preview the projects

First, get started with expo [here](https://expo.io/learn), and instead of creating a new project, just type in the command line:
`cd project-folder-name` 
then:
`expo start`

## 1. ToDo List App

A very simple App, in which you can add a list of items that could be deleted by clicking on them. This app is very basic and does not look pretty, but it is a good practise to get started.

## 2. Number Guess App

A simple game in which the user selects a number and the phone has to guess it. Uses a prettier style and layout.
