# React Native Projects

This repository has the code of the projects done within the course on [**Udemy: React Native the Partical Guide**](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/). 


## How to preview the projects

First, you have to set up your computer to get started with Expo for just a couple of minutes [here](https://expo.io/learn), and instead of creating a new project, just type in the command line:

`cd project-folder-name` 

then:

`expo start`



## Overview:
### Level Beginner 1	: [1. ToDo List App](#1-ToDo-List-App)

## 1. ToDo List App

A very simple App, in which you can add a list of items that could be deleted by clicking on them. This app is very basic and does not look pretty, but it is a good practise to get started.

## 2. Number Guess App

A simple game in which the user selects a number and the phone has to guess it. Besides, it uses a prettier style and layout.

## 3. Meals App

This App shows different recipes of meals of different categories. It uses Navigation Tab to switch between Meals and Favorites screens and a Drawer to set the Filters of preferred meals. The update of the Favorite meals and the Filters are implemented using Redux.
